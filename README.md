NGINX API Gateway
=================

This repo is an example of how to create an NGINX proxy as a gateway to your
micro services.

The beautiful thing is that you can run tests which verify that the gateway routing
is done correctly, meaning a request is routed to a specified service with a
specified path.

For example, you can verify that an HTTP call to http://api.mycompany.com/login is
routed to your authentication service with the /login path.

Each service states its routes in `app/services/service_name.conf`

All conf files are loaded to the main nginx.conf.

Running The Test
----------------

Just clone this repository and run
```bash
$ make test
```

in the root folder.

All tests should pass which means that:
1. A request to http://api.mycompany.com/login is routed to the authentication service
   with the /login path
2. A request to http://api.mycompany.com/messages is routed to the inbox
   service with the /messages path
